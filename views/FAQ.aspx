                CrowdLending.com investments are units of a limited liability company (LLC). Each property offered
                includes a single purpose, bankruptcy remote entity formed solely for the ownership and operation of
                that asset. LLCs are often the ideal method for real estate ownership since they bring investors the
                advantage of limited financial exposure. They also offer pass through taxation status and are
                reasonably flexible in the event that liquidation of ownership becomes necessary.

                  REIT shares are not the equivalent of physical ownership of real estate. They function in a fashion
                  similar to a derivative of real estate, since you own a portion of the company that owns the real
                  estate. You are not only at the mercy of that company management decisions, you are bound to their
                  strategy, the properties they purchase, and ultimately to the stock market’s constant instability.

                  financial engineering that can be decimated by the uncertainties of the stock market.

                Real estate investments typically operate on a longer time-frame than more liquid stocks or bonds.
                Each investment opportunity is accompanied by a thorough business plan that outlines the time-frame
                necessary to realize the investment. This may vary anywhere from one to ten years. The nature of the
                units in the LLC investment are considered “restricted shares” according to SEC guidelines and may
                not be sold openly to the public. It is our intention at CrowdLending.com to either partner with an
                established secondary market provider or develop a proprietary secondary market for these securities
                to provide the ultimate flexibility to investors.

                Like all forms of investing, commercial real estate entails risk. As an investor, you must be
                prepared for the potential loss of all of your investment. If this will render you unable to survive
                financially, or you are unwilling to accept the potential to lose the capital you have invested, we
                do not recommend you invest with us, or anyone else. With that fact established, we understand the
                value of total due diligence, deep underwriting of potential investments and other basics that reduce
                your risk. We are committed to offering only investments that meet our stringent criteria for
                information.Your investments will be backed by commercial real estate and Crowdlending.com will only
                accept first lien position on said real estate.

                Prior to investing with Crowdlending.com you will have to provide evidence that you are an accredited
                investor as defined by the Securities and Exchange Commission. Once that occurs we will coordinate
                the submission of your investment and accept payment via check or money order. Your money will then
                be used to issue loans to qualified borrowers with qualified projects. While all investments are
                difference the standard investment will be for a period of one year with quarterly interest only
                payments.

                their investments in their online portfolio. Our operating partners are required to report on the

                President Obama signed the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act (JOBS Act) into law in April of 2012.
                The intent of the JOBS Act is to provide more effective access to capital for small businesses and
                startups. Although a majority of the attention paid to Title III of the JOBS Act (which provides a
                legal framework to enable equity based crowdfunding), Title II potentially will have the greatest
                impact on CrowdLending.com. While CrowdLending.com will not rely initially on the implementation of
                the JOBS Act, Title II of the Act will lift the ban on general solicitation of certain securities and
                allow companies such as CrowdLending.com to offer investment opportunities to accredited investors
                where no prior meaningful relationship exists. After Title III regulations are fully enabled by the
                SEC, CrowdLending.com will be able to offer investment crowdfunding opportunities in their fullest
                sense, opening up to thirty trillion dollars of capital for investment in real estate opportunities
                around the nation. CrowdLending.com will truly bring Main Street back to Main Street<sup>(C).</sup>
